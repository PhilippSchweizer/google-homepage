HTML/CSS exercise project: re-build the google homepage.

Learning outcomes include:

    - moving divs around on the page
    - stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
    - use of developer tools
    - center an element horizontally
    - use of css classes and ids

I use this project merely as a refresher of my HTML and CSS skills.
